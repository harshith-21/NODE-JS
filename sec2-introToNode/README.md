### **HELLO WORLD**
```js
const hello = 'Hello warldd';
console.log(hello);
```
```bash
MBP-1AQ05D-GHR:sec2-introToNode harshithgandhe$ node index.js 
Hello warldd
```

### **To read a file - FS MODULE**

```js
const fs = require('fs');
```
> adding this require is like and import and "fs" is a module for handing files. Doing (importing this module) this would allow us to use its functions

>**USE DOCUMENTATION FOR KNOWING MORE ABOUT THESE STUFF**
> https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/fs.html

#### **USAGE :**
```js
const fs = require('fs');

const textIn = fs.readFileSync('./1-node-farm/starter/txt/input.txt', 'utf-8');
console.log(textIn);
```

    > MBP-1AQ05D-GHR:sec2-introToNode harshithgandhe$ node index.js 
    The avocado ðŸ¥‘ is popular in vegetarian cuisine as a substitute for meats in sandwiches and salads because of its high fat content ðŸ˜„


#### **Read file, add some more text to string and save that text to output.txt**
```js
const fs = require('fs');

const textIn = fs.readFileSync('./1-node-farm/starter/txt/input.txt', 'utf-8');
console.log(textIn);

const textOut = `This is what we know about the avacado: ${textIn}. \nCrearted on ${Date.now()}`;
fs.writeFileSync('./1-node-farm/starter/txt/ouput.txt', textOut); 
console.log('File is writen!');
```
 -  `` are using in ES6 
 -  anything inside ${} is compiled as js inside ``

```js
> console.log(`1+1 is ${1+1}`)
1+1 is 2
```


> file created at that location: /Users/harshithgandhe/Desktop/NODE-TUT/NODE-JS/sec2-introToNode/1-node-farm/starter/txt

    cat ouput.txt 
    This is what we know about the avacado: The avocado ðŸ¥‘ is popular in vegetarian cuisine as a substitute for meats in sandwiches and salads because of its high fat content ðŸ˜„. 
    Crearted on 1669098653403%

## SYNCHRONOUS and ASYNCHRONOUS
## **Blocking and non-Blocking nature of node JS**
Synchronous code - Blocking
Asynchronous code - Non Blocking

> if a function or code block is taking long time it will also stop other functions. so better to run them in background

![](images/Screenshot%202022-11-22%20at%203.11.00%20PM.png)

>we can also create a callback function to use the data which was loaded before

![](images/Screenshot%202022-11-22%20at%203.13.33%20PM.png)

## **ASYNC-FUNCTIONS**

```js
fs.readFile('./1-node-farm/starter/txt/start.txt', 'utf-8', (err,data) => {});
```
> (err,data) => {}

    this is the function that is called when the data is loaded
    readfile gives errror if any to err and data to data variable and and when its done proceeds to do whats inside
---
> full async function looks like below

```js
fs.readFile('./1-node-farm/starter/txt/start.txt', 'utf-8', (err,data) => {
    // console.log('hello from async function');
    console.log(data);
    console.log('hello from async function2');
});
console.log("will read file")
```
```bash
MBP-1AQ05D-GHR:sec2-introToNode harshithgandhe$ node index.js 
will read file
read-this
hello from async function2
```


### creating a lil callback hell
```js
fs.readFile('./1-node-farm/starter/txt/start.txt', 'utf-8', (err,data1) => {
    console.log(data1);
    fs.readFile(`./1-node-farm/starter/txt/${data1}.txt`, 'utf-8', (err,data2) => {
        console.log(data2);
    });
});
console.log("will read file")
```
> there is a file called read-this.txt in the corresponding folder
```bash
MBP-1AQ05D-GHR:sec2-introToNode harshithgandhe$ node index.js 
will read file
read-this
The avocado ðŸ¥‘ is also used as the base for the Mexican dip known as guacamole, as well as a spread on corn tortillas or toast, served with spices.
```

Adding one more call back
```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('./1-node-farm/starter/txt/start.txt', 'utf-8', (err,data1) => {
    console.log(data1);
    fs.readFile(`./1-node-farm/starter/txt/${data1}.txt`, 'utf-8', (err,data2) => {
        console.log(data2);
        fs.readFile(`./1-node-farm/starter/txt/append.txt`, 'utf-8', (err,data3) => {
            console.log(data3);
        });
    });
});
console.log("will read file")
```

```bash
MBP-1AQ05D-GHR:sec2-introToNode harshithgandhe$ node index.js 
will read file
read-this
The avocado ðŸ¥‘ is also used as the base for the Mexican dip known as guacamole, as well as a spread on corn tortillas or toast, served with spices.
APPENDIX: Generally, avocados ðŸ¥‘ are served raw, but some cultivars can be cooked for a short time without becoming bitter.
```

Addind those texts togather and writting into the file togather
```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('./1-node-farm/starter/txt/start.txt', 'utf-8', (err,data1) => {
    console.log(data1);
    fs.readFile(`./1-node-farm/starter/txt/${data1}.txt`, 'utf-8', (err,data2) => {
        console.log(data2);
        fs.readFile(`./1-node-farm/starter/txt/append.txt`, 'utf-8', (err,data3) => {
            console.log(data3);

            fs.writeFile('./1-node-farm/starter/txt/final.txt',`${data2}\n${data3}`, err => {
                console.log('file has been writtenðŸ˜Œ');
            })
        });
    });
});
console.log("will read file")
```
```bash
MBP-1AQ05D-GHR:sec2-introToNode harshithgandhe$ node index.js 
will read file
read-this
The avocado ðŸ¥‘ is also used as the base for the Mexican dip known as guacamole, as well as a spread on corn tortillas or toast, served with spices.
APPENDIX: Generally, avocados ðŸ¥‘ are served raw, but some cultivars can be cooked for a short time without becoming bitter.
file has been writtenðŸ˜Œ
```
Reading the above created file 
```
MBP-1AQ05D-GHR:sec2-introToNode harshithgandhe$ cat 1-node-farm/starter/txt/final.txt 
The avocado ðŸ¥‘ is also used as the base for the Mexican dip known as guacamole, as well as a spread on corn tortillas or toast, served with spices.
APPENDIX: Generally, avocados ðŸ¥‘ are served raw, but some cultivars can be cooked for a short time without becoming bitter.
```

### **Error handling**
```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('./1-node-farm/starter/txt/startttt.txt', 'utf-8', (err,data1) => {
    if(err) return console.log('ERROR!!!'); 

    console.log(data1);
    fs.readFile(`./1-node-farm/starter/txt/${data1}.txt`, 'utf-8', (err,data2) => {
        console.log(data2);
        fs.readFile(`./1-node-farm/starter/txt/append.txt`, 'utf-8', (err,data3) => {
            console.log(data3);

            fs.writeFile('./1-node-farm/starter/txt/final.txt',`${data2}\n${data3}`, err => {
                console.log('file has been writtenðŸ˜Œ');
            })
        });
    });
});
console.log("will read file")
```
As the file mentioned does not exists and we have added a return statement... prints the error and returns

```bash
MBP-1AQ05D-GHR:sec2-introToNode harshithgandhe$ node index.js 
will read file
ERROR!!!
```
